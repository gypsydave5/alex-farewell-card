Alex's Farewell Card
====================

Being [Alex's](https://github.com/alexpeattie) last week at Makers Academy, we ([Ruth](https://github.com/ruthearle), [James](https://github.com/jrmcneil), [Spike](https://github.com/spike01), [Ethel](https://github.com/ch2ch3), and I)  took on a project to send him off in proper fashion while making good use of the skills we learnt in Week 7. The website allows well-wishers to submit messages and displays the messages in tiles. Clicking on a tile shows the full message in a modal.

The final app can be viewed here: http://alex-farewell-card.herokuapp.com
